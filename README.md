Neural Interaction Laboratory under Dr. Todd Coleman at UCSD Bioengineering. This is a collaborative project
between Bioengineering UCSD, ECE UCSD, and the UCSD School of Medicine. 

We are interested in analyzing gait patterns of PD patients. This involves: step length, step width, step velocity, 
turn speed, cadence, posture, and variability across all these measures.

We are then interested in using statistical analysis to build robust models for analyzing differences between PD
and controls. This will involve things such as: Pearson Chi Square Normality test, Fisher's F test, Students T test,
ANOVA and multivariate regression. 

Eventually, we are interested in developing a Bayesian algorithm for predicting the severity of Parkinson's with the 
analysis of gait.
